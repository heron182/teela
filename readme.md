# Teela

A [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) bootstrap and application skeleton with [twelve-factor](http://www.12factor.net/) principles.

### Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Python Web framework
- [Flask-Cache](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Cache/) - Cache extension for Flask
- [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) - WSGI HTTP server
- [Honcho](https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho) - a Python clone of [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/)
- [Fabric](http://fabfile.org/) - command-line system admin, deployment, remote management

## Getting started

1. Install requirements (use [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv))

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run with Fabric

        $ fab run

### Application and environment configuration

Honcho adds the contents of `.env` file as environment variables. The application boostrap configures Flask using these settings, so edit or add to this file as you please - see [Flask configuration](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/config/).

**Note:** Defaults are defined in [the config class](teela/config.py) for some settings, so you don't need to duplicate these in your `.env` if you want to keep it minimal. Currently `SERVER_NAME` is the only requirement, which is used to determine the application `HOST` and `PORT`.

### Running locally

To run with Flask's development server, use:

    $ fab dev

Set `DEBUG=True` in your `.env` file to auto-reload with code changes. See the [fabfile](fabfile.py) for other commands.
